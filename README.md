# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks, making it particularly useful for predicting time series data like stock prices.

## Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging and important task in the financial domain. This project showcases a step-by-step approach to building an LSTM model for predicting stock prices. The main steps involved in the project are:

### Data Preprocessing:
  Loading the historical stock price data, performing data exploration, and normalizing the data to prepare it for modeling.
### Model Creation:
  Designing an LSTM neural network architecture using the Keras library, compiling it with appropriate loss and optimization functions.
### Training:
  Training the LSTM model on the prepared training dataset and validating it on a test dataset.
### Prediction:
  Using the trained model to predict stock prices on the test dataset and visualizing the results.
### Future Prediction:
  Extending the prediction to forecast stock prices for a certain number of upcoming days.
